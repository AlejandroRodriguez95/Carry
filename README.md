# Carry
First group project on unity

We worked together with other students to make a game
The game concept is similar to the game "overcooked". Here, you play as a nurse in a hospital, and you must reach the end of your shift, keeping your stress
level as low as you can.

The game was made using Unity, code is written in c#.

Since it was our first group project, the structure is not the best, the code is very clustered and comments can be misleading.
If you wish to check out the code, go to Carry -> Assets -> Scripts

You can find a playable build of the final version of the game here: https://simmeraut7.itch.io/carry

--- Issue: UI doesn't scale well with resolution -> we didn't realize it was a problem until after the game was finished
